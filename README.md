# About the project

Chess-System-Java is a POO project from the course [DevSuperior](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/).

The application consists of a chess game with all the rules and common mechanics including special moves like En passant, castling, and promotion.

# Note
I have complete knowledge of the POO logic implemented in the project, however the project and class logic are away above my level, i still need to improve this area. (03/26/2025)
